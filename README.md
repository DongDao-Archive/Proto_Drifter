# Drifter

## Project overview
### Concept
In Drifter, you are a **secret agent**, tasked with gathering information in enemy territories. Unfortunately, **your identity has been leaked**, and now, enemy agents are on the hunt for you! **Escape and destroy their cars** with your un-matched **drifting skills**.

## How to play?
**On Windows**
The executable game file (.exe) is at:
Project root/Packaged/

**On other platforms**
A link to a HTML build of the game is at:
Project root/Packaged/HTML build.txt

## Development
### Overview
Drifter was developed for an assignment in one of my game design unit. I was given approximately 1 week to design and build the game from start to finish. 
As the assignment was centred around the design aspect of game development, I put more emphasis on the design of Drifter and less on its aesthetic. My target was a functional, low fidelity prototype.
